# my-application(GET DA)
The year 2020-21 more like the lockdown year, brought down our productivity to a great  
extent. We could no more gain insights which was earlier possible by face to face  
interaction with peers and teachers. With almost no books and no one to guide during  
lockdown, we decided to build an app using which you can search your Assignments and download For Engineering Students. 


 
 Introduction:-  
Our app would have several questions along with detailed answers including a  
search bar in which a student or an user could directly enter a keyword and get  
all the related searches; Yeah just like all the search engines! It will be able to  
support any number of users as the users would be directly stored on cloud  
storage.
Firstly user need to signup and then after successful login he/she can choose their engineering branches i.e CSE,IT,CIVIL,ELECTRICAL,BIOTECH,MECHANICAL
and get their assignments for free 
if user want to upload some assignments he/she can upload it branchwise and will get some perks for that.
